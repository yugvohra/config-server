# config-server
Spring cloud config server that manages configs of microservices
# Spring microservices no longer need to maintain local configs. All configs can be checked-in into a centeralized repository 
# Configs can be changed at runtime and immediately loaded into the microservices by refreshing the context(instead of hard re-boot)
